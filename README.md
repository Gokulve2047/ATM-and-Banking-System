# AIM:
To develop the ATM and Banking System using Star UML

# Problem Statement:
1.Banks need to provide fast, secure, and self-service access to basic banking functionalities.

2.Manual banking for simple tasks (like cash withdrawal or balance inquiry) leads to long queues and inefficient use of bank staff.

3.There is a lack of consistent and secure user authentication in some older systems.

4.Existing ATM systems may not be user-friendly or may lack multilingual support.

5.Customers require 24/7 access to basic banking services without depending on bank working hours.

6.A reliable ATM software system is needed to:

7.Allow users to securely access their accounts using ATM cards and PIN.

8.Enable operations like cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, mini statement printing, and PIN change.

9.Ensure real-time processing and data consistency with the core banking system.

10.Provide a simple and intuitive user interface.
